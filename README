Miracast sending support for the Linux Desktop

Describes the status as of 2018-05-15, things will have changed considerably since then.

Current approach:
 * Python userspace program that just streams a test image
 * Program speaks directly with wpa_supplicant through dbus (bypassing NetworkManager)
 * Program tries to become group owner

Caveats:
 * Firewall may need to be adjusted for DHCP server
 * Does not properly reset state when killing (destruction of P2P Group)
 * Does not react to P2P group creation
 * Cannot start the DHCP server (or client) because of this
 * No support for audio streaming so far

Current status:

1. Restart wpa_supplicant

    sudo systemctl stop wpa_supplicant.service
    sudo systemctl start wpa_supplicant.service

2. Configure wpa_supplicant

    sudo ./rtsp.py 123456789123 pbc

3. Search devices from phone mobile (search for sinks for example)

4. Detect peers:

    sudo d-feet

    f1.w1.wpa_supplicant1.Interface.P2PDevice Peers

5. Start source:
 
    sudo ./rtsp.py 123456789123 pbc

6. Start streaming:

    sudo .run.sh
